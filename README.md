# general-knowledge-certification-system
The idea is to create a General Knowledge Certification system. A system that can guarantee people's knowledge, independently of which type it is.

The problem:

Today we have many institutions with credibility enough to ensure that people have some knowledge kind. 
We have institutions that ensure that people know how to speak in different languages. We have institutions to ensure that you completed graduation as well. But all of this is tied to money. People without access or self-taught are not backed up by institutions and don't have guarantees about their knowledge.

The solution:

An open source decentralized place where people can create generic tests. This place has to be able to ensure and certificate a third person performance on its tests.

The hardest part is to invalidate a test of a fraudulent person.
